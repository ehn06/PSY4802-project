#To visualize how I compare averages across different disagreement factors, I will use a boxplot/bar graph to visualize the difference in averages and spread between two different groups on the same disagreement factor. Graphs will be restricted by topic, so for example, one graph will be demonstrating how two groups differ between disagreement factors across all controversial topics.
